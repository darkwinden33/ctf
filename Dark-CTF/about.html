                            </h5>
                            Capture the flag, generally referred to as the CTF, is a popular outdoor game where two more teams each
                            have a flag or other symbol and the goal is to catch the flag of the other side. In the information security
                            context, the CTF case is an experiment that we set up to solve information security challenges and
                            participate in innovative experimentation in a controlled atmosphere with minimized implications for the
                            operation gene.

                                About DARK WINDEN CTF
                            </h5>
                            Dark is a German science fiction family drama series that focuses on Time Travelling. Dark was created by
                            Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese. Set in the fictional small town of Winden, it revolves around four
                            interconnected families haunted by their secrets and contains elements of science fiction and fantasy.
                            There is a complex family tree as well as connections among the characters in the storyline. This CTF is
                            based on these connections along with the events that occurred. This CTF is made to make the users
                            aware of Ransomware from the point of execution to recovery. The goal of this CTF is to get the decryption
                            key once the Ransomware is executed, and finally decrypt the “pass.txt” file that has been encrypted by
                            the Ransomware and that is stored in the root directory. Once the player starts playing the CTF, the first
                            instruction will be given to make sure that the user runs an executable file named “start” which is in the
                            home directory which will eventually act as the trigger to for the Ransomware program to be executed.
